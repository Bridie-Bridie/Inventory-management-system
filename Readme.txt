This is a project assigned to me as my college obligations for bachelor's completion. The project is created using HTML, 
CSS, Javascript, SQL and PHP. The concept of Ajax also has been implemented in this project. Based on the permissions 
for the system, the users in this system have been divided into:
1) Admin
